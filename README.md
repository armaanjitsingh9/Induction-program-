It was the first day of Induction program and I was very much happy because I became the part of Gndec family the college had organised a path of Japji sahib and kirtan to start with positive vibes.The Induction program is going to start and i was very much excited and nervous. Our HOD mam Dr Harpreet Kaur came and tell to remember our GOD before our chief guests arrives.It really helped me because it make me comfortable then our chief guest arrives he was Maheshinder Singh Grewal who is senior vice president of Shromni akali dal and ex MLA of Ludhiana west he told us why this college is opened and how many good engineers this college has produced he also told us about the importance of Communication and Language.
